# Kunai Language
## Repositories
- [kunai-lang/kunai](https://github.com/kunai-lang/kunai) ~ Contains documentation, planned features, and other information about the Kunai programming language.
- [kunai-lang/graphics](https://github.com/kunai-lang/graphics) ~ We use this to store graphics related to the Kunai programming language.

## Goals
My number one goal for Kunai is having full support for both desktop and mobile platforms.

A minor side goal I personally have is to come with a good package management system built in, similar to rust.
